        <p>Tagore’s philosophy of education that the aesthetic development of the senses is as important as the intellectual one. Hence music, art, literature, dance and drama are given great prominence in the daily life of our students.
            “I’m on a constant search to discover what the world of education is upto within the country and globally. Many models in learning and methodologies have become inspiration for us to figure out ways of achieving the same results, and we have been adapting them. Eventually, we would want our students to be prepared for the world that is soon to be theirs so that they can build it responsibly.”
            Herewith I run the Institution where my teachers are keen-on not what the children are being taught but how they are being taught. We are empowered by the great faith of parents that their wards certainly become the icons of different 
            aspects of life.
