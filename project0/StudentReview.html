        <p> School is VERY Important. I am sure you have probably heard every
             grown-up in your life tell you. But the honest truth is that schooling is
              an absolute fundamental step to a successful life. We sometimes take school and classes for granted.
               But we forget that by going to school you get a compressed crash course on the collective knowledge of mankind. By getting an education you “skip the line” and 
               see further metaphorically by standing on the shoulders of giants who came before you.

       <p> I know for me growing up as a teenager, I went through a phase where I did not appreciate school and did not do too well either. I would zone out in my core subject classes 
           and overall just didn’t care. Back then for me, motivational school quotes inspired me to persevere</p>
